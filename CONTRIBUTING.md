Building great things is not easy. It's a journey. 🚀

It requires scientific rigor - or our science will be mid 🗿

We believe that good science requires giving freedom to the scientist.

Our goal is to improve LLMs, video generation, and more, but the method is not to tell you what to do, but to inspire you and let you think of research you believe in.

To keep the hing quality of our research, here are some legit real deal no-cap rules:

0. If you didn't read your AI generated text / code, don't expect others to (don't submit it 🤗). AI generated experiment descrption and code are mid.
1. AI can not replace your thinking - understand what is happening.
2. Reviewers can quickly tell low-effort, unreviewed AI output from quality work — especially in PR descriptions. Clearly and concisely explain what you did, why, and how, even if the experiment failed / results were negative - those are also valuable. 📝
3. Make your first 1-2 sentences of pull request show the value of your contribution. ✨
4. Ask questions. 🤔
5. Don't create contributions just to appear as contributor (eg. "typo fix"). 🚫
6. Remember - science is not a chase for clout or quick dopamine - it's a journey of your curiosity (and low effort contributions will repulse employers, not attract them). 🧠
