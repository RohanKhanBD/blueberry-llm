Building great things is not easy. It's a decades long journey. 🚀

It requires scientific rigor - or our science will be bad. 🔬

When you join a research lab, you will experience some tough love, so I will show you what it looks like here:

0. If you didn't read your AI generated text / code, don't expect others to (don't submit it 🤗).
1. AI can not replace your thinking - understand what is happening.
2. Do not submit AI generated code or pull requests that you didn't read / understand / review / edit - it will not be good ❌
3. Reviewers can quickly tell low-effort, unreviewed AI output from quality work — especially in PR descriptions. Clearly and concisely explain what you did, why, and how, even if the experiment failed / results were negative - those are also valuable. 📝
4. Make your first 1-2 sentences of pull request show the value of your contribution. ✨
5. Ask questions. 🤔
6. Don't create contributions just to appear as contributor (eg. "typo fix"). 🚫
7. Remember - science is not a chase for clout or quick dopamine - it's a life-long journey of your curiosity (and low effort contributions will repulse employers, not attract them). 🧠
