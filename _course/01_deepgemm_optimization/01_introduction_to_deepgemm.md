# Lesson 1: Introduction to DeepGEMM

Welcome to the first lesson on DeepGEMM! This lesson introduces you to the world of high-performance computing for deep learning, focusing on the DeepGEMM project. We'll explore what DeepGEMM is, why it's important, and how it leverages cutting-edge techniques to accelerate AI workloads.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the role of GEMM in deep learning.
- Learn what DeepGEMM is and its primary goals.
- Discover the key optimization techniques used in DeepGEMM, such as FP8 and specialized CUDA kernels.
- Appreciate the importance of hardware-specific optimizations for modern GPUs.

## 1. What is GEMM and Why is it Important?

GEMM stands for **GEneral Matrix Multiplication**. It's a fundamental operation in linear algebra, and it's at the heart of many deep learning computations.  Training and inference of neural networks involve vast numbers of matrix multiplications. Therefore, optimizing GEMM is crucial for achieving high performance in AI applications.

## 2. Introducing DeepGEMM

DeepGEMM is a project focused on creating highly optimized GEMM kernels for deep learning workloads. It's designed to squeeze every last drop of performance out of modern GPUs, particularly NVIDIA's Hopper architecture (SM90).

The core idea behind DeepGEMM is to go beyond generic, one-size-fits-all libraries and write specialized CUDA kernels that are tailored to the specific needs of modern transformer models.

## 3. Key Optimization Techniques in DeepGEMM

DeepGEMM employs several advanced techniques to achieve its high performance:

*   **FP8 (8-bit Floating Point):**  DeepGEMM leverages the new FP8 data format available on Hopper GPUs. FP8 reduces the memory footprint and can significantly speed up computations, but it requires careful handling to maintain model accuracy.
*   **Specialized CUDA Kernels:** Instead of relying on general-purpose libraries, DeepGEMM uses custom-written CUDA kernels for specific tasks like Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Paged Attention.
*   **Hardware-Specific Optimizations:** The kernels in DeepGEMM are written with a deep understanding of the underlying hardware, making use of features like Tensor Cores and TMA (Tensor Memory Accelerator) to their full potential.

## 4. Code Examples: A Glimpse into DeepGEMM

Let's take a look at a small snippet from the DeepGEMM codebase. This C++ code defines an API for a fused FP8 MQA logits kernel. Don't worry if you don't understand all the details yet; we'll dive deeper in future lessons.

```cpp
static torch::Tensor fp8_mqa_logits(const torch::Tensor& q,
                                    const std::pair<torch::Tensor, torch::Tensor>& kv,
                                    const torch::Tensor& weights,
                                    const torch::Tensor& cu_seq_len_k_start,
                                    const torch::Tensor& cu_seq_len_k_end,
                                    const bool& clean_logits) {
    // ... implementation details ...
}
```

This is just one example of the highly specialized functions you'll find in DeepGEMM.
