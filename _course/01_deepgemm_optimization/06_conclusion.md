# Lesson 6: Conclusion and Putting It All Together

Congratulations on completing this course on DeepGEMM! You've taken a deep dive into the world of high-performance computing for deep learning, from the fundamentals of GEMM to the cutting-edge techniques used in modern attention mechanisms.

## What You've Learned

Let's take a moment to recap the key concepts we've covered:

- **The Importance of GEMM:** You learned that GEMM is a fundamental operation in deep learning and that optimizing it is crucial for performance.
- **DeepGEMM's Approach:** You saw how DeepGEMM uses specialized, hand-tuned CUDA kernels to achieve maximum performance on modern GPUs.
- **FP8 and Hardware Acceleration:** You explored how DeepGEMM leverages hardware features like FP8 and Tensor Cores to accelerate computations.
- **Advanced Attention Mechanisms:** You delved into the details of Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Paged Attention, two key optimizations for serving large language models.
- **The Codebase:** You navigated the DeepGEMM codebase, from the Python API down to the C++ and CUDA kernel implementations.

## The Big Picture: The Future of High-Performance AI

The techniques you've learned about in this course are not just academic exercises. They are essential for the future of AI. As models continue to grow in size and complexity, the need for efficient, high-performance inference solutions will only become more critical.

Projects like DeepGEMM are at the forefront of this field, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with modern hardware. By understanding the principles behind these projects, you are well-equipped to contribute to the next generation of AI systems.

## Where to Go from Here?

Your journey into high-performance deep learning is just beginning. Here are some suggestions for what to do next:

- **Experiment with the Code:** If you have access to a suitable GPU, try running the tests in the DeepGEMM project. Modify the code, experiment with different parameters, and see how it affects performance.
- **Read the Research Papers:** Many of the techniques we've discussed, like Paged Attention, were first introduced in research papers. Reading these papers will give you a deeper understanding of the concepts.
- **Contribute to Open Source:** Projects like DeepGEMM are often open source. Contributing to these projects is a great way to learn and make an impact.
- **Explore Other Libraries:** DeepGEMM is not the only project in this space. Look into other libraries like CUTLASS, Triton, and vLLM to see different approaches to the same problems.
