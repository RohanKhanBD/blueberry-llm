\section{Introduction}

The Blueberry LLM represents our approach to democratizing large language model training by making it accessible on consumer hardware, with our experiments demonstrating feasibility on modern GPUs including RTX 4090 with the ambitious goal of training LLMs for under \$1. Our mixture of experts (MoE) language model leverages cutting-edge DeepSeek components and optimization techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency through sparse activation patterns. This technical report presents three comprehensive experiments that systematically evaluate DeepSeek's innovations within the Blueberry LLM framework: (1) a comprehensive ablation study across 5 different configurations revealing the true impact of different architectural components; (2) a learning rate optimization study for DeepSeek Attention + MLP architectures; and (3) a comprehensive optimization study for DeepSeek Attention + GLM4 MoE architectures. These experiments collectively demonstrate the feasibility of cost-effective LLM training on consumer hardware.

Our Blueberry LLM architecture combines the efficiency benefits of MoE with the performance improvements offered by DeepSeek's innovative components. The model employs a top-2 routing strategy across 8 experts, allowing for specialized processing while maintaining computational tractability.

DeepSeek has introduced several innovative components that enhance traditional transformer architectures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{LoRA-style Q/K/V projections}: Low-rank adaptation techniques for efficient parameter updates
    \item \textbf{RoPE scaling}: Rotary Position Embedding scaling for better positional encoding
    \item \textbf{Attention bias}: Additional bias terms in attention computations
    \item \textbf{DeepSeek RMSNorm}: Enhanced root mean square layer normalization
\end{itemize}

Our research objectives for the Blueberry LLM are to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Conduct comprehensive ablation studies to understand component interactions and dependencies across 5 different configurations
    \item Evaluate the effectiveness of DeepSeek attention mechanisms within MoE architectures compared to standard multi-head attention
    \item Investigate DeepSeek MLP architectures and their integration with MoE systems across different model sizes
    \item Analyze DeepSeek MoE implementations and their performance compared to baseline approaches
    \item Optimize learning rates for DeepSeek Attention + MLP architectures to achieve optimal performance
    \item Optimize DeepSeek Attention + GLM4 MoE architectures with systematic expert count and routing analysis
    \item Identify optimal architectures that balance performance, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness across all three experimental paradigms
    \item Provide quantitative analysis of performance, efficiency, and parameter usage for MoE models with DeepSeek components
    \item Demonstrate the feasibility of training high-performance LLMs on consumer hardware for under \$1
    \item Establish the Blueberry LLM as a practical solution for accessible AI development
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}

Recent work in transformer optimization has focused on improving attention mechanisms and normalization techniques. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) has emerged as an effective method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning \cite{hu2021lora}. RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding) has shown significant improvements in handling positional information \cite{su2021roformer}. RMSNorm has been proposed as an alternative to LayerNorm, offering computational efficiency while maintaining performance \cite{zhang2019root}.

DeepSeek's contributions build upon these foundations while introducing novel enhancements that warrant systematic evaluation within MoE architectures. The Blueberry LLM represents our effort to integrate these innovations into a practical MoE framework.
