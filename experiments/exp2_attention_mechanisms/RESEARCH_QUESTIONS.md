# DeepSeek Sparse Attention Research Questions

## Core Architecture
1. **Why do we need extra weight for indexer score?** (`w_t,j^I` necessity)
2. **Can we use DSA on classic attention instead of MLA?**
3. **What is the optimal k value for different sequence lengths?**

## Lightning Indexer
4. **How does indexer performance scale with sequence length?**
7. **How does scaling influence indexer accuracy and computational efficiency?**
