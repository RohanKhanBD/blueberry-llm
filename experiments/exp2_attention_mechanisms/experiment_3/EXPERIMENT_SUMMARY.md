# Experiment 3: Dynamic Sparsity and Adaptive Attention Patterns - COMPLETED

## üéØ Research Objective

**Investigate adaptive sparsity patterns that dynamically adjust based on sequence characteristics to optimize both pretraining speed and quality in transformer models.**

## üî¨ Scientific Approach

### Hypothesis
Adaptive sparsity patterns that adjust based on sequence characteristics (length, content complexity, attention entropy) will outperform fixed sparsity patterns in both training speed and model quality.

### Experimental Design
- **Baseline Models**: Dense attention, Fixed sparse (25%, 50%, 75%)
- **Experimental Model**: Adaptive sparse with dynamic k calculation
- **Sequence Lengths**: 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048
- **Multiple Seeds**: 3 runs per configuration for statistical significance
- **Metrics**: Training speed, convergence, final performance, memory efficiency

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation

### Core Components

1. **ContentComplexityAnalyzer**: Analyzes token diversity, perplexity estimation, and sequence variance
2. **AttentionEntropyEstimator**: Estimates attention entropy without computing full attention matrix
3. **AdaptiveKCalculator**: Combines multiple factors to calculate optimal k values
4. **DynamicSparsityController**: Orchestrates all adaptive components
5. **LightningIndexer**: Implements DeepSeek's token relevance scoring
6. **TopKTokenSelector**: Selects top-k tokens with adaptive k values

### Models Implemented
