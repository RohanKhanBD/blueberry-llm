## Abstract

This thesis presents a comprehensive empirical study comparing the Muon optimizer (Momentum Orthogonalized by Newton-Schulz) against the widely-used Adam optimizer for training Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) transformer models. This work also analyzes the design philosophy of novel optimizers and employs systematic ablations to deconstruct their behavior, providing insights into the optimizer design process itself. Through systematic hyperparameter optimization spanning 45+ experiments, optimal configurations for both optimizers are identified, and a fair performance comparison is provided. This systematic analysis reveals fundamental design principles for neural network optimizers, particularly regarding the interplay between learning rates, momentum, and second-order curvature information.

Key findings demonstrate that Muon achieves 7% better validation loss (5.16 vs 5.55) compared to fully-optimized Adam at 500 training steps, with an even more pronounced 15% improvement (5.72 vs 6.73) at early training stages (200 steps). Critically, it is discovered that Muon exhibits substantially different optimization dynamics than Adam: it requires learning rates 70× higher (0.07 vs 0.001), tolerates a 30× wider range of learning rates, benefits from cosine learning rate schedules while Adam prefers constant rates, and requires warmup while Adam performs better without it.

Through extensive ablation studies, Muon's optimal configuration is identified to use momentum of 0.9, weight decay of 0.2, and cosine learning rate decay with 5% warmup. For Adam, it is found that constant learning rates without warmup yield superior results for the experimental setup, contradicting common practices. Newton-Schulz iteration analysis reveals that 3 steps provide comparable quality to 5 steps while offering 40% computational savings.

These results establish Muon as a superior optimizer for MoE transformer training, offering not only better final performance but also greater robustness to hyperparameter selection and faster early-stage convergence. Beyond empirical comparison, this work derives key design principles for optimizer development: the importance of gradient orthogonalization for robustness, the trade-off between second-order information and computational overhead, and the distinct scheduling requirements of different optimizer classes. This work provides practical guidelines for practitioners deploying micro-scale MoE models and contributes to the growing understanding of second-order optimization methods in deep learning.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

The optimization algorithm is a fundamental component of deep learning systems, directly influencing training efficiency, convergence speed, and final model quality. While Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) [Kingma & Ba, 2015] has become the de facto standard optimizer for training neural networks due to its adaptive learning rates and robust performance across diverse architectures, recent years have seen the emergence of novel optimization methods that challenge this dominance.

The Muon optimizer (Momentum Orthogonalized by Newton-Schulz) represents a novel design that leverages second-order information through Newton-Schulz iterations for gradient orthogonalization [Malladi et al., 2024]. Unlike traditional second-order methods that require expensive Hessian computations, Muon achieves computational efficiency through approximate orthogonalization while potentially offering superior convergence properties. Understanding the design choices behind Muon—particularly its gradient orthogonalization mechanism—provides valuable insights for optimizer development.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models [Shazeer et al., 2017; Fedus et al., 2022] present unique optimization challenges due to their sparse activation patterns, routing mechanisms, and load balancing requirements. The interaction between routing dynamics and optimizer behavior remains understudied, making MoE models an ideal testbed for comparing optimization algorithms.

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1 Optimization Algorithms in Deep Learning

#### 2.1.1 First-Order Methods

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) [Robbins & Monro, 1951] forms the foundation of neural network optimization. Despite its simplicity, SGD with momentum [Polyak, 1964; Sutskever et al., 2013] remains competitive for many tasks. However, its requirement for careful learning rate tuning limits its applicability.

Adaptive learning rate methods address this limitation by adjusting learning rates per parameter. RMSprop [Tieleman & Hinton, 2012] and AdaGrad [Duchi et al., 2011] pioneered this approach. Adam [Kingma & Ba, 2015] combines momentum with adaptive learning rates and has become the dominant optimizer in deep learning. AdamW [Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019] improves upon Adam by decoupling weight decay from gradient updates, becoming the preferred variant.

Recent work has explored variants like RAdam [Liu et al., 2020], which addresses warm-up heuristics, and AdaBound [Luo et al., 2019], which transitions from Adam to SGD during training. However, these improvements are typically incremental.

#### 2.1.2 Second-Order Methods

Second-order methods leverage curvature information from the Hessian matrix to achieve faster convergence. Newton's method and quasi-Newton methods like L-BFGS [Liu & Nocedal, 1989] are well-established in convex optimization but face scalability challenges in deep learning due to O(n²) memory requirements for storing Hessian approximations.

Natural gradient descent [Amari, 1998] uses the Fisher information matrix instead of the Hessian, providing a geometrically motivated approach. K-FAC [Martens & Grosse, 2015; Grosse & Martens, 2016] approximates the Fisher matrix using Kronecker factors, making second-order methods tractable for neural networks.

Shampoo [Gupta et al., 2018] and its successor Distributed Shampoo [Anil et al., 2020] use a different matrix factorization approach, achieving impressive results on large-scale models. However, these methods still incur significant computational overhead.

#### 2.1.3 The Muon Optimizer

Muon (Momentum Orthogonalized by Newton-Schulz) [Malladi et al., 2024] represents a novel approach that bridges first and second-order methods. Unlike traditional second-order methods that compute expensive matrix inverses, Muon uses Newton-Schulz iterations [Higham, 1986] to efficiently orthogonalize gradients.

The Newton-Schulz iteration approximates the matrix inverse through the recurrence:

```
X_{k+1} = X_k(2I - AX_k)
```

This converges quadratically (the error shrinks extremely fast) when initialized appropriately, providing an efficient alternative to explicit matrix inversion. Muon applies this to orthogonalize gradient directions, potentially leading to better optimization trajectories.

Key advantages of Muon include:
- Computational efficiency: O(n) memory, avoiding explicit Hessian storage
- Orthogonalized updates: Better gradient conditioning
- Theoretical grounding: Connection to natural gradient methods

However, Muon remains relatively understudied compared to Adam, with limited empirical validation across different architectures and tasks.

### 2.2 Mixture-of-Experts Models

#### 2.2.1 MoE Architecture

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models [Jacobs et al., 1991; Jordan & Jacobs, 1994] partition the model into multiple "expert" networks, with a gating mechanism selecting which experts process each input. This conditional computation allows scaling to enormous parameter counts while maintaining reasonable computational costs.

The modern sparse MoE transformer architecture [Shazeer et al., 2017] replaces the dense feed-forward layers in transformers with MoE layers. Each token is routed to a subset of experts (typically top-k where k=2), providing model capacity without proportional computational increase.

Key components include:
- **Gating Network**: Learns to route tokens to appropriate experts
- **Expert Networks**: Specialized sub-models that process inputs
- **Load Balancing**: Mechanisms to prevent expert collapse
- **Routing Strategy**: Top-k selection, soft routing, or learned routing

#### 2.2.2 Training Challenges

MoE models present unique optimization challenges:

1. **Load Balancing**: Without careful regularization, all tokens may route to a few experts, wasting capacity [Lepikhin et al., 2021].

2. **Expert Utilization**: Ensuring all experts contribute meaningfully to the model.

3. **Routing Instability**: Gating decisions can be unstable early in training.

4. **Gradient Flow**: Sparse activation patterns affect gradient statistics.

5. **Learning Rate Sensitivity**: Router and expert learning rates may require different tuning.

These challenges make MoE models particularly interesting for studying optimizer behavior, as the optimizer must handle both the gating dynamics and expert parameter updates effectively.

#### 2.2.3 Prior Work on MoE Optimization

Switch Transformers [Fedus et al., 2022] explored training stability and proposed simplified routing with load balancing losses. GLaM [Du et al., 2022] scaled MoE models to trillions of parameters. ST-MoE [Zoph et al., 2022] introduced stability improvements for vision-language models.

However, systematic comparisons of optimization algorithms for MoE models remain limited. Most work uses Adam by default without exploring alternatives. This work addresses this gap.

### 2.3 Hyperparameter Optimization

#### 2.3.1 Learning Rate Selection

Learning rate is widely recognized as the most important hyperparameter [Bengio, 2012]. Common strategies include:

- **Grid Search**: Systematic evaluation of predefined values
- **Random Search**: Sampling from distributions [Bergstra & Bengio, 2012]
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Model-based sequential optimization [Snoek et al., 2012]
- **Population-Based Training**: Evolutionary approach [Jaderberg et al., 2017]

Learning rate schedules modify the learning rate during training. Common schedules include:

- **Step Decay**: Reduce LR at fixed intervals
- **Exponential Decay**: Continuous exponential reduction
- **Cosine Annealing**: Smooth cosine-based reduction [Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017]
- **Warmup**: Gradual increase at the start [Goyal et al., 2017]

The optimal learning rate often depends on batch size, model architecture, and optimizer choice.

#### 2.3.2 Momentum and Weight Decay

Momentum parameters control the exponential moving average of gradients (β₁) and second moments (β₂ for Adam). Common values are β₁=0.9 and β₂=0.999 for Adam, though these may not be optimal for all settings.

Weight decay provides regularization by penalizing large weights. AdamW [Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019] showed that decoupled weight decay outperforms L2 regularization for adaptive optimizers.

#### 2.3.3 Systematic Ablation Studies

Ablation studies isolate the effect of individual hyperparameters by varying one while holding others constant. This methodology is essential for understanding optimizer behavior and identifying optimal configurations.

This work employs systematic ablation across multiple dimensions: learning rate, momentum, weight decay, schedule type, warmup ratio, and Muon-specific parameters (Newton-Schulz iterations, Nesterov momentum).

### 2.4 The Evolution and Design of Optimizers

The design of neural network optimizers has evolved through several distinct generations, each addressing specific limitations of its predecessors through novel theoretical insights and structural adaptations.

#### 2.4.1 First Generation: Momentum and Acceleration
The earliest neural network optimizers were direct adaptations of classical optimization methods. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) introduced the concept of noisy updates from mini-batches, which was later found to be crucial for generalization. The addition of **Momentum** [Polyak, 1964] represented the first major design innovation, introducing a "velocity" state to dampen oscillations and accelerate traversal through flat regions of the loss landscape. This established the fundamental design pattern of maintaining optimizer state (buffers) to smooth the optimization trajectory.

#### 2.4.2 Second Generation: Adaptivity
The realization that different parameters require different learning rates led to the adaptive family of optimizers. **AdaGrad** [Duchi et al., 2011] introduced the concept of accumulating squared gradients to scale updates, effectively "slowing down" frequent features and "speeding up" rare ones. **RMSprop** [Tieleman & Hinton, 2012] refined this by using exponential moving averages to handle non-stationary objectives. **Adam** [Kingma & Ba, 2015] synthesized these ideas, combining the first-moment acceleration of Momentum with the second-moment adaptivity of RMSprop. Its design philosophy focused on robustness and "out-of-the-box" performance, making it the default choice for a decade.

#### 2.4.3 Third Generation: Decoupling and Simplification
As models grew, subtle flaws in Adam became apparent. **AdamW** [Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019] corrected the implementation of weight decay, demonstrating that regularization should be decoupled from the adaptive gradient update. This highlighted a key design principle: the interaction between regularization and optimization mechanics must be explicitly designed, not assumed. More recently, **Lion** [Chen et al., 2023] demonstrated that complex adaptive statistics might be unnecessary, achieving state-of-the-art performance using only momentum and the sign operation, suggesting that the *direction* of the update is often more important than its precise magnitude.

#### 2.4.4 Fourth Generation: Structure-Aware Optimization
The current frontier, represented by **Muon**, **Shampoo**, and **K-FAC**, moves beyond treating parameters as flat vectors. These "structure-aware" optimizers recognize that neural network weights are matrices or tensors with specific spectral properties.
- **Shampoo** [Gupta et al., 2018] approximates second-order preconditioning using Kronecker products.
- **Muon** [Malladi et al., 2024] uses Newton-Schulz iterations to orthogonalize weight updates, effectively enforcing a hard constraint on the update geometry rather than a soft penalty.

This evolution reveals a clear trend: from simple scalar updates to adaptive scalar scaling, and now to full-matrix conditioning that respects the underlying geometry of the parameter space.

### 2.5 Research Gap

While Adam has been extensively studied and Muon shows theoretical promise, several gaps remain:

1. **Limited MoE Evaluation**: Muon has not been comprehensively evaluated on MoE models.

2. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Most comparisons use default settings rather than optimized configurations for each optimizer.

3. **Systematic Ablations**: The effects of individual hyperparameters on Muon vs Adam are not well understood.

4. **Practical Guidelines**: Clear recommendations for practitioners are lacking.

This thesis addresses these gaps through systematic experimentation and analysis.

**Phase 2: Hyperparameter Ablation**
- Momentum variations
- Weight decay variations
- Learning rate schedule types
- Warmup ratio variations
- Muon-specific parameters (Newton-Schulz steps, Nesterov momentum)

**Phase 3: Final Comparison**
- Use optimal configurations identified in Phases 1-2
- Extended training runs
- Statistical validation

#### 3.1.2 Experimental Design Principles

**Expert Utilization**: For MoE models, the distribution of tokens across experts, ensuring balanced routing.

#### 3.2.3 Statistical Considerations

All experiments use fixed random seeds (seed=42) to ensure deterministic results. While this enables perfect reproducibility, it limits statistical inference. For critical comparisons, it is noted that replication with multiple seeds would strengthen conclusions.

Best validation loss (minimum across all checkpoints) and final validation loss (at training completion) are reported. The best validation loss indicates model potential, while final loss reflects training stability.

### 3.3 Hyperparameter Search Strategy

**Adam LR Range**: 0.0001 to 0.01
- Fast sweep (200 steps): 11 values
- Extended sweep (500 steps): 3 values around optimum

The fast sweeps provide rapid feedback for narrowing search ranges, while extended sweeps validate findings with longer training.

#### 3.3.2 Ablation Study Design

For each hyperparameter, the following are tested:
- Below-optimal value
- Optimal value (baseline)
- Above-optimal value

This three-point design efficiently characterizes response curves while minimizing computational cost.

**Momentum Values**: 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, 0.97, 0.99

## 5. Results

This chapter presents the empirical results of the comprehensive comparison of Muon and Adam optimizers. Results are organized by experimental phase: learning rate sweeps, hyperparameter ablations, and final optimized comparisons.

### 5.1 Learning Rate Sweeps

#### 5.1.1 Muon Learning Rate Sweep

Two learning rate sweeps were conducted for Muon:

**Fast Sweep (200 steps)**: Initial exploration

| LR Value | Best Loss | Final Loss | Final Acc | Time (min) |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|

**Key Observations**:
- Optimal LR: **0.07** (loss: 5.7239)
- Sweet spot: 0.05-0.09 range
- Performance degrades sharply below 0.03 and above 0.1
- LR of 0.02 still trains (loss: 7.05) but is suboptimal
- Very high LRs (0.15) lead to poor convergence

**Extended Sweep (500 steps)**: Validation of optimal region

| 0.01     | 9.0635    | 9.0635     | 0.1077    | 0.78       |

**Key Observations**:
- Optimal LR: **0.001** (loss: 6.7262)
- Narrow sweet spot: 0.0007-0.002
- Performance degrades rapidly outside this range
- LR=0.01 is 70× higher than optimal (loss: 9.06)
- Much more sensitive to LR than Muon

**LR Comparison**:
- Muon optimal: 0.07
- Adam optimal: 0.001
- **Ratio: 70× higher LR for Muon**

**Tolerance Comparison**:
- Muon workable range: 0.02-0.09 (4.5× range)
- Adam workable range: 0.0007-0.002 (2.86× range)

**Key Findings**:
- **Lower momentum is better** for Muon (counterintuitive!)
- Momentum=0.9 optimal (loss: 5.19)
- Performance degrades with higher momentum
- Difference between 0.9 and 0.99: 2.4%

This contradicts typical intuition that higher momentum helps convergence. For Muon, lower momentum appears to provide better gradient conditioning.

#### 5.2.2 Weight Decay Variations (Muon)

**Key Findings**:
- **NS steps have minimal impact on quality**
- 3 steps: 5.19 loss, 1.65 min (15% faster)
- 5 steps: 5.19 loss, 1.95 min (baseline)
- 10 steps: 5.19 loss, 2.15 min (10% slower)
- **Recommendation: Use 3 steps for production** (saves 15% time)

This is a crucial finding for practical deployment: Muon's orthogonalization can be approximated with fewer iterations without quality loss.

#### 5.2.4 Nesterov Momentum (Muon)

| Experiment | Nesterov | Best Loss | Final Loss | Time (min) |
|------------|----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| muon_optimal | True | 5.1867 | 5.1867 | 1.95 |
| muon_optimal_no_nesterov | False | 5.1935 | 5.1935 | 1.95 |

**Key Findings**:
- Nesterov momentum provides minimal benefit (0.35%)
- Can be enabled (default) without harm
- Not a critical hyperparameter

#### 5.2.5 Warmup Variations (Muon)

| Experiment | Warmup Ratio | Best Loss | Final Loss | Time (min) |
|------------|--------------|-----------|------------|------------|

| muon_warmup_0.1 | 0.1 | 5.2296 | 5.2296 | 1.95 |
| muon_warmup_0.2 | 0.2 | 5.3842 | 5.3842 | 1.95 |

**Key Findings**:
- **Warmup is critical for Muon** (7.6% improvement)
- Optimal warmup: 5% (default)
- No warmup significantly hurts performance (5.58 vs 5.19)
- Too much warmup (20%) also degrades performance

#### 5.2.6 Learning Rate Schedules (Muon)

| Experiment | Schedule | Best Loss | Final Loss | Time (min) |
|------------|----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| **muon_optimal** | **Cosine** | **5.1867** | **5.1867** | 1.95 |

| muon_step_decay | Step | 5.2518 | 5.2518 | 1.95 |
| muon_constant_lr | Constant | 5.2518 | 5.2518 | 1.95 |

**Key Findings**:
- **Cosine decay works best** for Muon
- Constant LR is 2.4% worse (5.25 vs 5.19)
- Linear and step decay are intermediate
- **Muon benefits from learning rate scheduling**

#### 5.2.7 Adam Optimization Suite

Using Adam's optimal LR of 0.001:

| Experiment | Schedule | Warmup | WD | Best Loss | Time (min) |
|------------|----------|--------|--------|-----------|------------|
| **adam_constant_lr_optimal** | **Constant** | **None** | 0.1 | **5.5477** | 1.80 |
| adam_no_warmup | Cosine | None | 0.1 | 5.5887 | 1.80 |
| adam_warmup_0.1 | Cosine | 10% | 0.1 | 5.7280 | 1.79 |
| adam_optimal | Cosine | 5% | 0.1 | 5.7521 | 1.82 |
| adam_optimal_wd_0.2 | Cosine | 5% | 0.2 | 5.7733 | 1.79 |
| adam_optimal_wd_0.05 | Cosine | 5% | 0.05 | 5.8084 | 1.80 |
| adam_linear_decay | Linear | 5% | 0.1 | 5.8106 | 1.79 |

**Key Findings**:
- **Constant LR is best for Adam!** (5.55 vs 5.75 with cosine)
- **No warmup improves Adam** (5.59 vs 5.75 with warmup)
- **Opposite behavior to Muon**: Adam prefers constant LR, no warmup
- Weight decay variations don't help
- Best Adam configuration: LR=0.001, constant, no warmup

This surprising finding contradicts common practice. For this model/task, Adam performs better without the typical cosine schedule and warmup.

### 5.3 Final Optimized Comparison

```

#### 5.3.2 Performance Comparison

| Metric | Muon | Adam | Difference |
|--------|------|------|------------|
| **Validation Loss (500 steps)** | 5.158 | 5.548 | **7.0% better** |
| **Validation Loss (200 steps)** | 5.724 | 6.726 | **14.9% better** |
| **Training Time (500 steps)** | 1.95 min | 1.80 min | 8.3% slower |

| **LR Tolerance Range** | 0.02-0.09 | 0.0007-0.002 | **~30× wider** |

**Statistical Significance**:
With fixed random seeds, consistent improvements are observed across multiple checkpoint evaluations. The 7% improvement at 500 steps and 15% at 200 steps represent substantial gains in model quality.

#### 5.3.3 Convergence Dynamics

**Early Training (0-100 steps)**:
- Muon converges faster due to higher LR
- Loss decreases more rapidly with Muon
- At 100 steps: Muon ~6.5, Adam ~7.2 (10% gap)

**Mid Training (100-300 steps)**:
- Both optimizers continue improving
- Gap widens slightly
- At 200 steps: Muon 5.72, Adam 6.73 (15% gap)

**Late Training (300-500 steps)**:
- Muon continues improving with cosine decay
- Adam plateaus with constant LR
- Final: Muon 5.16, Adam 5.55 (7% gap)

**Interpretation**:
Muon's advantage is most pronounced in early training, suggesting better gradient conditioning leads to faster initial convergence. The advantage persists through convergence, indicating not just faster training but better final solutions.

#### 5.3.4 Computational Efficiency

**Per-Step Time**:
- Muon: 0.234 sec/step (500 steps)
- Adam: 0.216 sec/step (500 steps)
- **Overhead: 8.3%**

**Newton-Schulz Overhead**:
- With NS=5: 8.3% overhead
- With NS=3: ~4% overhead (estimated)

**Time-to-Accuracy**:
To reach 5.8 validation loss:
- Muon: ~50 steps (11.7 seconds)
- Adam: ~150 steps (32.4 seconds)
- **Muon is 2.8× faster** to reach this milestone

This demonstrates that despite slightly higher per-step cost, Muon's better convergence leads to faster time-to-accuracy for practical training scenarios.

### 5.4 Robustness Analysis

#### 5.4.1 Learning Rate Robustness

**Muon Performance Across LRs** (500 steps):
- LR=0.005: 5.813 (12.7% worse than optimal)
- LR=0.01: 5.539 (7.4% worse)
- LR=0.03: 5.313 (3.0% worse)
- **LR=0.07: 5.187 (optimal)**
- LR=0.1: 5.335 (2.9% worse)

**Adam Performance Across LRs** (200 steps):
- LR=0.0005: 7.078 (5.2% worse than optimal)
- LR=0.0007: 6.906 (2.7% worse)
- **LR=0.001: 6.726 (optimal)**
- LR=0.002: 6.822 (1.4% worse)
- LR=0.003: 7.012 (4.2% worse)

**Robustness Score** (% deviation from optimal within workable range):
- Muon: Average 5.6% deviation across 0.02-0.09
- Adam: Average 3.3% deviation across 0.0007-0.002

While Adam shows lower deviation within its narrow range, Muon's dramatically wider workable range (30× larger) makes it significantly more robust in practice. A practitioner has much higher chance of finding a good LR for Muon.

#### 5.4.2 Training Stability

**Loss Variance**:
All experiments completed successfully without divergence, indicating both optimizers are stable under tested configurations.

**Expert Utilization** (MoE-specific):
Both optimizers maintain balanced expert utilization (load balancing loss effectively prevents collapse). No significant differences observed.

## 6. Analysis and Discussion

### 6.1 Why Does Muon Outperform Adam?

#### 6.1.1 Gradient Conditioning Through Orthogonalization

The fundamental advantage of Muon lies in its gradient orthogonalization through Newton-Schulz iterations. This provides better-conditioned updates compared to Adam's adaptive learning rates.

**Theoretical Perspective**:
- Adam adapts learning rates based on second moment estimates (diagonal preconditioning)
- Muon orthogonalizes gradients, approximating natural gradient directions
- Orthogonalization provides full-matrix preconditioning (approximated efficiently)
- This leads to better-conditioned optimization landscapes

**Empirical Evidence**:
- Faster early convergence (15% better at 200 steps)
- Better final solutions (7% better at 500 steps)
- Higher learning rates possible (70× higher)

The orthogonalization effectively "straightens out" the optimization trajectory, allowing larger steps without instability.

#### 6.1.2 Learning Rate Dynamics

Muon's ability to use 70× higher learning rates is not merely a hyperparameter difference—it reflects fundamentally different optimization dynamics.

**Higher Learning Rates Enable**:
- Faster exploration of parameter space
- Larger updates per step
- Better escape from poor local minima
- Faster convergence to good solutions

**Why Muon Tolerates High LRs**:
- Orthogonalized gradients are better behaved
- Update directions are more aligned with true descent directions
- Natural gradient interpretation provides theoretical justification

This suggests Muon is operating in a different regime than Adam, closer to second-order methods in behavior despite first-order computational cost.

#### 6.1.3 MoE-Specific Advantages

For Mixture-of-Experts models specifically:

**Routing Stability**: Better gradient conditioning may help stabilize routing decisions during early training, leading to better expert specialization.

**Expert Utilization**: Both optimizers maintain balanced expert usage, but Muon may lead to better expert quality (as evidenced by lower loss).

**Sparse Gradient Handling**: MoE models have sparse activation patterns. Muon's orthogonalization may better handle the non-uniform gradient statistics this creates.

### 6.2 Optimization Dynamics Differences

#### 6.2.1 Schedule Preferences

**Muon Benefits from Cosine Decay**:
- With schedule: 5.19 loss
- Without schedule: 5.25 loss (2.4% worse)

**Adam Prefers Constant LR**:
- With constant: 5.55 loss
- With schedule: 5.75 loss (3.6% worse)

**Interpretation**:
- Muon's high initial LR benefits from gradual decay
- Adam's lower LR is already conservative; reducing it further hurts
- The optimal operating points differ fundamentally

This suggests practitioners should not assume schedule/warmup practices transfer between optimizers.

#### 6.2.2 Warmup Requirements

**Muon Requires Warmup**:
- With warmup: 5.19 loss
- Without warmup: 5.58 loss (7.5% worse)

**Adam Works Better Without Warmup**:
- Without warmup: 5.59 loss
- With warmup: 5.75 loss (2.9% worse)

**Interpretation**:
- Muon's high LR needs gradual ramp-up to avoid early instability
- Adam's low LR is already conservative enough for immediate full use
- Different optimization dynamics require different initialization strategies

#### 6.2.3 Momentum Behavior

**Muon Prefers Lower Momentum** (0.9 optimal):
- Momentum 0.9: 5.19 loss
- Momentum 0.99: 5.31 loss (2.4% worse)

This counterintuitive result suggests:
- Orthogonalization already provides directional consistency
- High momentum may interfere with adaptive orthogonalization
- Lower momentum allows more responsive updates

For Adam (default β₁=0.9), higher momentum is standard. The difference may relate to how momentum interacts with the different update rules.

### 6.3 Practical Implications

#### 6.3.1 Hyperparameter Tuning Effort

**For Muon**:
- Wider LR tolerance (30×) makes tuning easier
- More forgiving to suboptimal choices
- Can start with LR=0.07 and adjust if needed
- Fewer iterations required to find good settings

**For Adam**:
- Narrow LR tolerance requires careful tuning
- Performance degrades rapidly outside small range
- May require more extensive search
- Default LR=0.001 is reasonable starting point

**Recommendation**: Muon's robustness makes it more practical for scenarios where extensive hyperparameter search is infeasible.

#### 6.3.2 Computational Considerations

**Training Time**:
- Muon: 8% slower per step
- But 2.8× faster to reach quality thresholds
- Overall wall-clock advantage in practice

**Memory Usage**:
- Newton-Schulz iterations require temporary buffers
- Memory overhead is modest (O(d) for d-dimensional tensors)
- Not a limiting factor for practical deployment

**Production Deployment**:
- Use NS=3 instead of 5 for 15% speedup
- No quality loss observed
- Brings per-step overhead to ~4%

#### 6.3.3 When to Use Each Optimizer

**Use Muon When**:
- Training large models (benefits from better conditioning)
- Limited hyperparameter search budget (robust to LR)
- Want faster convergence (higher LR possible)
- Working with MoE models (demonstrated advantage)
- Can afford 4-8% computational overhead

**Use Adam When**:
- Computational budget is extremely tight
- Default settings work well (some domains)
- Existing infrastructure optimized for Adam
- Risk-averse deployment (Adam is well-understood)

**Use Both (Hybrid)**:
- Muon for high-dimensional parameters (attention, FFN)
- Adam for low-dimensional (embeddings, norms)
- This is the configuration found to be optimal

### 6.4 Limitations and Threats to Validity

#### 6.4.1 Experimental Limitations

**Single Random Seed**:
- All experiments use seed=42 for reproducibility
- Cannot assess variance across random initializations
- Results may not generalize to different seeds
- **Mitigation**: Consistency across many experiments increases confidence

**Limited Training Duration**:

- **Mitigation**: Loss is standard proxy for language model quality

**Statistical Testing**:
- Deterministic results preclude statistical tests
- Cannot compute p-values or confidence intervals
- **Mitigation**: Effect sizes are large (7-15% improvements)

#### 6.4.3 Generalization Concerns

**Model Scale**:
- 79M parameters is relatively small
- Results may differ for billion+ parameter models
- Computational tradeoffs may shift at scale

**Hardware Specifics**:
- Single GPU training

### 6.5 Comparison to Prior Work

#### 6.5.1 Muon Evaluations

The results align with original Muon paper [Malladi et al., 2024]:
- Confirms advantages over Adam
- Demonstrates robustness to hyperparameters
- Shows higher optimal learning rates

Contributions of this work:
- First comprehensive comparison on MoE models
- Systematic hyperparameter optimization for both optimizers

#### 6.5.2 Adam Optimization Literature

The finding that Adam prefers constant LR (for this setup) contrasts with common practice:
- Cosine schedules are standard [Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017]
- Warmup is typically beneficial [Goyal et al., 2017]

Possible explanations:
- Short training duration (500 steps)
- Specific model/dataset combination
- Interaction with MoE routing dynamics

This highlights the importance of task-specific tuning rather than assuming universal best practices.

#### 6.5.3 MoE Optimization

Prior work on MoE optimization [Fedus et al., 2022; Lepikhin et al., 2021] focuses primarily on:
- Load balancing mechanisms
- Routing strategies
- Stability improvements

This work contributes:
- First systematic optimizer comparison for MoE
- Demonstrates both optimizers maintain stable routing
- Shows Muon advantages extend to sparse models

### 6.6 Theoretical Insights

## 6.6 Theoretical Insights and Design Philosophy

### 6.6.1 Connection to Natural Gradient

Muon's orthogonalization can be viewed as approximating natural gradient descent:
- Natural gradient uses Fisher information matrix
- Orthogonalization approximates whitening transform
- Both aim to remove ill-conditioning

This theoretical grounding explains:
- Why higher LRs are possible (better-conditioned updates)
- Why convergence is faster (closer to Newton's method)
- Why robustness improves (less sensitivity to scale)

### 6.6.2 Adaptive vs. Orthogonal Philosophies

Adam and Muon represent two distinct design philosophies for handling ill-conditioned curvature:

**The Adaptive Philosophy (Adam)**:
- **Assumption**: Parameters are independent scalars.
- **Mechanism**: Scale each parameter's update inversely to its gradient variance.
- **Goal**: Equalize the effective learning rate across parameters.
- **Limitation**: Ignores correlations between parameters (diagonal approximation).

**The Orthogonal Philosophy (Muon)**:
- **Assumption**: Parameters form structured matrices/tensors.
- **Mechanism**: Constrain the update matrix to be isometric (orthogonal).
- **Goal**: Equalize the update magnitude across all directions in the parameter space.
- **Advantage**: Respects the underlying geometry of linear transformations.

### 6.6.3 The Shift to Structure-Awareness

The experimental results of this thesis support a fundamental shift in optimizer design philosophy: moving from **element-wise adaptivity** to **structure-aware conditioning**.

1.  **Geometry Matters**: The 7-15% performance gap confirms that treating weight matrices as flat vectors (Adam) discards critical structural information. Muon's success validates the philosophy that the optimizer should "know" it is optimizing a matrix, not just a list of numbers.

2.  **Constraint vs. Penalty**: Traditional weight decay acts as a soft penalty. Muon's orthogonalization acts as a hard geometric constraint on the update. The results suggest that hard constraints on update geometry (forcing orthogonality) are more effective for training stability than soft penalties, allowing for much more aggressive learning rates (70x higher).

These are complementary approaches. Hybrid configurations combining both (as used in this study) may capture benefits of each.

## 6.7 Principles for Designing Novel Optimizers

Based on the comparative analysis of Muon and Adam, and the broader history of optimizer development, this section synthesizes key principles and guidelines for researchers designing the next generation of neural network optimizers.

### 6.7.1 Design Guidelines

**1. Respect Parameter Geometry**
Treating all parameters as flat vectors (as Adam does) ignores the rich structural information in weight matrices. Novel optimizers should distinguish between different parameter types (e.g., 2D weights vs. 1D biases) and apply transformations appropriate to their geometry. Muon's success with matrix orthogonalization demonstrates the power of this approach.
*Empirical Connection*: The primary comparison (Section 5.3) showed that Muon, which respects the 2D geometry of attention and feed-forward matrices, outperformed the geometry-agnostic Adam by 7-15%, validating that structural priors are critical for MoE transformers.

**2. The "Orthogonalization" Principle**
Adaptive methods (Adam) scale updates by magnitude, while orthogonal methods (Muon) condition updates by direction. The superior performance of Muon suggests that *conditioning the update direction* to be orthogonal or whitened is often more effective than simply scaling the step size. Future optimizers should explore efficient approximations of whitening transformations (like Newton-Schulz) rather than just variance-based scaling.
*Empirical Connection*: The momentum ablation (Section 5.2.1) revealed that Muon prefers lower momentum (0.9) than typically used with SGD. This suggests that the orthogonalization process itself provides sufficient directional consistency, reducing the reliance on heavy momentum smoothing for stability.

**3. Decouple Update Magnitude from Direction**
A robust optimizer should separate the determination of the update *direction* (gradient processing) from the update *magnitude* (learning rate scheduling). Muon's requirement for a schedule and warmup, unlike Adam's preference for constant rates, indicates that when the direction is well-conditioned (orthogonalized), the magnitude must be carefully managed to exploit this conditioning.
*Empirical Connection*: The schedule ablations (Section 5.2.6) demonstrated that Muon requires a cosine schedule and warmup to manage the magnitude of its orthogonalized updates, whereas Adam performs best with a constant LR. This confirms that better directional conditioning (Muon) shifts the burden of stability to the learning rate schedule.

**4. Computational "Sweet Spot"**
Pure second-order methods (Newton's method) are O(n³) and infeasible. First-order methods (SGD) are O(n) but require many steps. The design goal is to find operations that are O(n) or slightly super-linear but provide "second-order-like" benefits. Muon's Newton-Schulz iteration is a prime example: a small constant number of matrix multiplications (O(n)) yields a high-quality approximation of a complex operation.
*Empirical Connection*: The Newton-Schulz ablation (Section 5.2.3) showed that reducing iterations from 5 to 3 maintained model quality (5.19 loss) while reducing computational overhead. This identifies the specific "sweet spot" where the cost of structure-awareness is outweighed by its convergence benefits (2.8x faster time-to-accuracy).

### 6.7.2 Research Methodology for New Optimizers

**1. Theoretical Grounding**: Start with a clear hypothesis about the loss landscape (e.g., "gradients are ill-conditioned in this specific way"). Derive the update rule from first principles (e.g., natural gradient, trust region) rather than heuristics.

**2. Toy Problem Validation**: Validate the optimizer on simple, controllable problems (e.g., Rosenbrock function, small XOR networks) to verify it behaves as theoretically predicted before scaling up.

**3. Systematic Ablation**: When a new optimizer works, rigorously ablate every component. Is the improvement due to the novel update rule, or just a better default learning rate? (As seen with Lion, sometimes the sign operation alone is sufficient).

**4. Robustness Profiling**: Do not just report the best result. Report the *range* of hyperparameters under which the optimizer performs well. A method that is 1% better but requires 100x more tuning effort is not a practical contribution.

**5. Scale Testing**: Optimization dynamics change with scale. A method that works for ResNet-50 may fail for a 7B LLM. Test on the largest scale feasible, or at least on architectures (like MoE) known to be challenging.

## 7. Conclusion

### 7.1 Summary of Findings

This thesis presented a comprehensive empirical comparison of the Muon and Adam optimizers for training Mixture-of-Experts transformer models. Through 45+ systematic experiments spanning learning rate sweeps, hyperparameter ablations, and optimized comparisons, several key findings were established:

**Performance Advantage**: Muon achieves 7% better validation loss (5.16 vs 5.55) compared to fully-optimized Adam at 500 training steps, with a more pronounced 15% advantage (5.72 vs 6.73) at early training stages (200 steps).

**Learning Rate Dynamics**: Muon requires learning rates 70× higher than Adam (0.07 vs 0.001) and tolerates a 30× wider range of learning rates (0.02-0.09 vs 0.0007-0.002), demonstrating substantially greater robustness to hyperparameter selection.

**Optimization Dynamics**: Fundamental differences in optimization behavior were identified. Muon benefits from cosine learning rate schedules and requires warmup, while Adam performs better with constant learning rates and no warmup—contradicting common practices and highlighting the importance of optimizer-specific tuning.

**Hyperparameter Insights**: For Muon, it was found that lower momentum (0.9), higher weight decay (0.2), and cosine schedules yield optimal performance. For Adam, constant learning rates without warmup proved superior in this setting.

**Computational Efficiency**: Newton-Schulz orthogonalization can use 3 iterations instead of 5 without quality loss, reducing computational overhead from 8% to approximately 4% while maintaining Muon's advantages. Time-to-accuracy analysis shows Muon reaches quality thresholds 2.8× faster despite slightly higher per-step cost.

### 7.2 Contributions

This work makes several contributions to the deep learning optimization literature:

1. **Fair Comparison Methodology**: By independently optimizing both optimizers rather than comparing default configurations, a more rigorous performance comparison is provided that accounts for hyperparameter sensitivity.

2. **MoE-Specific Evaluation**: This represents the first systematic comparison of optimization algorithms specifically for Mixture-of-Experts models, an increasingly important architecture class.

3. **Optimization Dynamics Analysis**: The identification of fundamental differences in how Muon and Adam respond to schedules, warmup, and momentum provides insights into their distinct optimization mechanisms.

4. **Practical Guidelines**: Concrete recommendations are provided for practitioners, including optimal hyperparameters, robustness characteristics, and efficiency improvements.

5. **Open Science**: All code, configurations, and results are made available for reproducibility and extension by the research community.

### 7.3 Practical Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following are recommended:

**For Production MoE Training**:
```python
# Recommended Muon Configuration
optimizer = "muon_hybrid"  # Muon + AdamW hybrid
muon_lr = 0.07
adamw_lr = 0.007
momentum = 0.9
weight_decay = 0.2
ns_steps = 3  # For efficiency
nesterov = True
lr_schedule = "cosine"
warmup_ratio = 0.05
```

**Expected Benefits**:
- 7% better validation loss than optimized Adam
- 15% better at early training
- More robust to LR misspecification
- Faster convergence with higher learning rates

**When Adam May Be Preferred**:
- Extremely tight computational budgets
- Existing optimized Adam infrastructure
- Domains where extensive Adam tuning has been performed

### 7.4 Limitations

This study has several limitations that should be considered:

**Scale**: Evaluation was performed on a 79M parameter model with 500-step training runs. Results may differ for billion-parameter models with extended training.

**Statistical Variance**: Using a single random seed prevents formal statistical testing. While effect sizes are large, variance across seeds is unknown.

**Domain Specificity**: The focus was on language modeling. Results may not generalize to computer vision, reinforcement learning, or other domains.

**Architecture Specificity**: Results are specific to the MoE transformer configuration used. Other architectures may show different relative performance.

**Hyperparameter Space**: Despite testing 45+ configurations, interaction effects and potentially better settings may exist.

### 7.5 Broader Impact

**For Practitioners**: Muon offers a practical alternative to Adam with better performance and robustness, particularly valuable when hyperparameter tuning resources are limited.

**For Researchers**: The methodology demonstrates the importance of fair optimizer comparisons with independent hyperparameter optimization for each method.

**For MoE Development**: As MoE models continue scaling, understanding optimizer interactions with sparse activation patterns becomes increasingly important.

**For Optimization Theory**: The contrasting behaviors of Muon and Adam regarding schedules and warmup highlight gaps in the theoretical understanding of why these techniques help.

## 8. Future Work

### 8.1 Immediate Extensions

**Multi-Seed Evaluation**: Replicate experiments across multiple random seeds to quantify variance and enable statistical testing. This would strengthen confidence in the generalizability of results.

**Extended Training**: Evaluate both optimizers over 10,000+ training steps to assess whether relative performance changes at convergence. Early advantages may or may not translate to long-term benefits.

**Larger Models**: Scale to billion-parameter models to verify that findings hold at the scale of modern large language models. Optimization dynamics may shift substantially with scale.

**Downstream Tasks**: Evaluate fine-tuning performance on downstream tasks (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE) to verify that lower validation loss translates to better task performance.

### 8.2 Architectural Variations

**Dense Transformers**: Evaluate on standard (non-MoE) transformers to determine whether Muon's advantages are MoE-specific or general.

**Vision Models**: Test on vision transformers and convolutional networks to assess domain transferability.

**Other Sparse Models**: Evaluate on other sparse architectures (sparse attention, mixture of depths, etc.) to understand Muon's behavior with different sparsity patterns.

**Encoder-Decoder Models**: Test on sequence-to-sequence models (T5, BART) which have different training dynamics than decoder-only models.

### 8.3 Optimization Methodology

**Hybrid Configurations**: Systematically explore different ways to combine Muon and Adam (which parameters use which optimizer).

**Adaptive NS Iterations**: Investigate whether the number of Newton-Schulz iterations should vary during training (e.g., more early, fewer later).

**Learning Rate Scheduling**: Explore more sophisticated schedules specifically designed for Muon's high-LR regime.

**Regularization Interactions**: Study how Muon interacts with other regularization techniques (dropout, layer dropout, stochastic depth).

### 8.4 Distributed Training

**Multi-GPU Training**: Evaluate optimizer performance and overhead in distributed data parallel settings.

**Model Parallelism**: Assess Muon's behavior with pipeline and tensor parallelism, which introduce communication overhead.

**Gradient Accumulation**: Investigate whether effective batch size differently affects Muon vs Adam.

**Communication Efficiency**: Analyze whether orthogonalization enables more efficient gradient compression for distributed training.

### 8.5 Theoretical Investigation

**Convergence Analysis**: Develop theoretical understanding of why Muon tolerates higher learning rates and exhibits different schedule preferences.

**Loss Landscape Analysis**: Visualize loss landscapes traversed by each optimizer to understand trajectory differences.

**Hessian Analysis**: Compute Hessian statistics to verify that Muon achieves better conditioning.

**Natural Gradient Connection**: Formally analyze the relationship between Muon's orthogonalization and natural gradient descent.

### 8.6 Practical Tools

**Auto-tuning**: Develop automated hyperparameter selection methods specifically for Muon.

**Monitoring**: Create visualization tools for understanding Newton-Schulz iteration behavior during training.

**Production Integration**: Build optimized implementations for popular frameworks (Hugging Face Transformers, JAX, etc.).

**Best Practices Guide**: Develop comprehensive guidelines for practitioners across different model types and scales.
